# ## About data
# <blockquote><i>application_train/application_test</i>: This is main training and testing data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature <i>SK_ID_CURR</i>. The training application data comes with the TARGET indicating 0: the loan was repaid or 1: the loan was not repaid. Feature descriptions are as below. These have been taken from file <i>'HomeCredit_columns_description.csv'>/i>. For a more accurate description, please refer to the file.</blockquote>
